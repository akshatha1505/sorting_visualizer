# Sorting Visualizer - Website

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer Website is a project that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a hands-on learning experience for understanding how algorithms like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort work to sort data efficiently.

## Features

- Visualize Sorting Algorithms: The website enables users to visualize the different sorting algorithms. This interactive visualization helps users grasp the sorting process intuitively.

- Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. This flexibility allows for comparisons and a deeper understanding of algorithmic differences.

- Speed Control: The Sorting Visualizer offers speed control options, allowing users to adjust the animation speed to their preference. This feature helps users observe the sorting process at different speeds.

- Array Size Control: Users can also control the size of the input array. Experimenting with different array sizes helps demonstrate how algorithms perform with varying data sets.

## Technologies Used

The project was implemented using the following technologies:

- HTML: For structuring the webpage.
- CSS: For styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing the sorting algorithms and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Visit the Sorting Visualizer Website.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.
3. Adjust the speed and array size as desired.
4. Click the "Visualize" button to watch the sorting algorithm in action.
5. Observe and learn from the visualization to understand how the chosen algorithm works.
